0. Pseudo code every step of the way. Make all variables semantic. Test each line of code.

1. In the html, I constructed a div with an ID of #results; the layout allowed for all relevant article data to be displayed; later this div would be removed from the html, only to be inserted later via the DOM when news articles populate the feed.

2. 80% of my elements received both a class and ID for more control in styling/positioning.

3. I wrote out an Ajax get request using jQuery to access the News API and once I received a key, I logged the data to begin learning how to work with the array of objects returned and which data from the object I wanted to display.

4. I querySelected each element by id and changed it's inner html to the value of it's respective key from the News API data; I used template literals to aid in how the text reads.

5. I created a for loop to iterate through the array of objects

6. Once I got the data loading how I wanted it to, I added functionality to clear the results automatically upon a new search; I added tags in the form of buttons that can be clicked to add the value to the search bar for quicker searches; I added a button to clear the feed

7. Lastly I applied CSS and focused on making the document responsive for mobile

8. Once the positioning, functionality and CSS was up to PAR, I went back and tightened up my code, getting rid of anything I didn't need such as pseudocode that was no longer relevant and console.logs.

DESIRED ADDITIONS:

1. I would like to add buttons that, on click, allow the user to save/store a story for later

2. I'd like to broaden the search topics we can search for

3. I want the suggested search tags to be draggable and droppable rather than click and 13

STRUGGLES:

1. I struggled greatly with the build of my AJAX get request; In many cases I had to start over

2. As all API's are different, I had to find one that really spoke my language; this changed my plans, but it also taught me a great deal about API's and AJAX in general and made me more flexible and persistent when coding

3. I didn't initially remember that I would need to construct the html, only to remove it later, all to add it back via the dom. This is a technique I employed when building my functional to-do list app and it really comes in handy.
